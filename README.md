### Article on LinkedIn: Using data to nudge people

In the article [“What is the one thing that you keep putting off again and again until tomorrow?”](https://tinyurl.com/ArticleClarissa), I talk about how I was able to use simple data to nudge people into avoiding procrastination.

### Python - Customer Segmentation Project: K-Means Clustering

This is a project based on the article [Customer Segmentation using Python](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/customer-segmentation-using-python-e56c2b1a4c73) and the video [Data Analyst Portfolio Project #2: Python Customer Segmentation & Clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwUli5gIcU0).

__Customer segmentation__ is the process of dividing customers into groups in order to optimize a company's marketing strategy and maximize the value of each customer.

For this project, we covered the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset
    - Univariate Analysis
    - Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
2. Segmentation using the K-Means algorithm
    - Univariate Clustering
    - Bivariate Clustering
    - Multivariate Clustering

### Python - Project from Dataquest: Working with Missing Data

In this mission from the Dataquest platform, the main goal is to learn the basics on how to handle missing data without having to drop rows and columns. The techniques used include: 

- imputation: filling in a missing value with a replacement value
- plotting the missing values: to understand visually how the missing values are distributed
- correlating missing values: to find out if there's any pattern among the missing values.

The given dataset is comprised of vehicle collisions in New York City from the year 2018 in a csv file and the project is set up on a Jupyter Notebook.

### SQL Data Exploration

This project was based on and inspired by a [video from Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM).

Its goal is to showcase how to perform data exploration using SQL on a database with COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccination worlwide and by country. The dataset was downloaded from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) on August 16, 2021, and contains data until August 15, 2021. The notebook with the analysis and thought process are on a file called [Portfolio Project 1 - SQL Data Exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/clayamakita/project_1_sql_data_exploration/blob/main/Portfolio%20Project%201%20-%20SQL%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb).

The skills used in this project include: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, and Creating Views.

### Tableau - Data Visualization Project: Airbnb 2016 Listings in Seattle

This project was based on and inspired by a [video from Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOR0-nygfDE).

It displays data from Airbnb listings in the city of Seattle in 2016. The dashboard is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/clarissa.yamakita/viz/Airbnb2016ListingsinSeattle/Dashboard).

### Tableau - Data Visualization Project: Marketing Campaigns

This project used a [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) which presents data about customers purchases through different channels and use of discounts from marketing campaigns. This dashboard is a work in progress.
