Here are some of the projects developed so far.

### Project from Dataquest: Working with Missing Data

In this mission from the Dataquest platform, the main goal is to learn the basics on how to handle missing data without having to drop rows and columns. The techniques used include: 

- imputation: filling in a missing value with a replacement value
- plotting the missing values: to understand visually how the missing values are distributed
- correlating missing values: to find out if there's any pattern among the missing values.

The given dataset is comprised of vehicle collisions in New York City from the year 2018 in a csv file and the project is set up on a Jupyter Notebook.
